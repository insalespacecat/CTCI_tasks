This repository contains solutions on general computer science tasks that are given on the interviews.

It splits problems by themes.
Java solutions are situated under main.java.themes.
They are divided in subfolders. 
Mainly thematic subfolders contain tasks that
- Were given in Cracking the coding interview (CTCI) book chapter, which are relatively simple
- Were solved in LeetCode during training sessions on (mostly) Medium, but sometimes Hard and Easy tasks. 

Tasks might be marked with the following tags:

- R: Failed to create a solution that passes all the tests on LeetCode and had to watch explanation.
Those are usually a mess because at the end he tries any possible brute force to make it work throwing out the efficiency))
They might contain the right solution. They are to be re-solved in the future runs.

- Y: Task is solved and solution is not terrible, but not as good as it might be. Usually those type of solutions come out 
when the author gets a taste of the theme and wants to feel that he can implement the algorithm/data structure
and does not want to bother with Complexity and tries to make decent solution "feeling the complexity". Those are to be
re-visited and solved ideally on the following re-solving sessions. 

Each task class usually contains src + description.

Tasks may have fully (or not so fully) implemented tests on JUnit that are situated under test.java.themes
