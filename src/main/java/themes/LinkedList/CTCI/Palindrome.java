    //Implement a function to check if the given list is a palindrome

    //OK, the algorithm will be pretty much the same as for arrays
    //1) Ask for encoding (we will use ASCII) and which characters we will have to process
    //2) Ask if list is singly linked or doubly linked

    //If list is doubly linked we just create two pointers (1 at start and 1 at end)
    //and compare each pointer's data cell.

    //If list is singly linked list
    //we might want to decide if we stick with
    //it or we
